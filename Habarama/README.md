# Habarama
Habarama is the RaspberryPi part of the Hogarama Project.
Sensors are connected to the RaspberryPi and a client reads the sensor data which sends it to an AcitveMQ broker.

## Ansible
Ansible is used to configure the RaspberryPi and install the client.
For more information on how to setup your RaspberryPi as Habarama client with ansible please refer to [this link](https://github.com/Gepardec/Hogarama/wiki/Habarama-Setup-Guide).

## Clients
Currently there is a working python client.
The Java client is under development.
