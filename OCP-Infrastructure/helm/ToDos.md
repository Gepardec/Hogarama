# ToDos for HELM-ifying Hogarama

1. get everything working/deployable with helm
2. template the [insert something here] out of hogarama
3. proper yaml syntax (e.g. begin file with '---' and end with '...')
4. think about using more stable charts instead of custom resources
3. delete stuff that isn't required (e.g. empty values.yaml and other stuff)
