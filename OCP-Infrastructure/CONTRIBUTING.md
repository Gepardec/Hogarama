# Contributing to Hogarama Infrastructure

**First of all: Contributions are welcome!**

There are multiple ways to contribute: report bugs, improve the docs, and
contribute code.

## Pull Requests

Please use the following guidlines for pull requests:

 - Reference a Github issue that corresponds to your contribution.
 - Run the tests so your patch doesn't break existing functionality.


## Our Internal Process 

To understand why it may take some days until someone is looking at your contributions, 
here is a short description of our process for external contributions.

Each Friday the Hogarama core developers gather for a short meeting and look through the new pull requests. 
Contributions are assigned to one of the developers who will do a code review. 
Depending on the result he or she will merge, ask for changes or reject the merge request.
