How to contribute
---------------------------------

Our Documentation is contained in the :code:`/docs` folder and available as github page https://gepardec.github.com/Hogarama. We use the make file to generate html code via 

.. code-block:: bash
   
    make clean && make html

Changes to the docs need to be done in :code:`/docs/source`. In this folder you can use the existing rst (ReStructuredText) files for your documentation or create new ones.

The content of :code:`/docs/build` is generated by make html and should not be edited manually. Any manual changes done to this directory will most likely be undone by the next execution of :code:`make clean && make html`.
