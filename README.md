We use our *Home and Garden Automation* to water our office plants. As all good applications have a catchy name, we came up with an abbreviation and started to call our application "Hogarama". Hogarama is a distributed application consisting of multiple components. Managing all the components can be cumbersome, hence we use a few tools to make managing Hogarama a breeze. To find out more about Hogaram check out our documentation at [our wiki](https://github.com/Gepardec/Hogarama/wiki)
